# Runtime for KallistiOS
Minimal Ada/SPARK run-time for [KallistiOS](https://github.com/KallistiOS/KallistiOS "KallistiOS").

This is very much Work-In-Progress (with the definition of Progress close to quasistatic progress).

It is currently very minimal and lacks the real connection with the underlying OS. 

Alire support has been removed to avoid any confusion. sh-elf is not a supported
target, alire can't be used yet.
